# Title: Forecast Stock Market Trends and Portfolio Optimization Using Neural Networks and Machine Learning Algorithms.

# Research question:
1)	Which machine learning algorithms are the most efficient at forecasting stock values in the FTSE 100?
2)	Does the use of technical indicators such as Moving Averages, RSI, MACD enhance the forecasting accuracy of machine learning models for stock returns?
# Project Objectives:
1)	Construct a machine learning model that utilizes Yahoo Finance data to forecast stock prices from different sectors and optimize stock investments.
2)	Investigate the impact of different technical indicators on the capabilities which impact the prediction of machine learning models.
# Summary of project and background:
The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of standard momentum investing techniques in comparison to advanced models based on machine learning in forecasting returns on the stock market and optimizing investment portfolios. The research will use historical stock price data from the FTSE 100 index using Yahoo Finance to deploy and assess several machine learning methods such as LSTM, CNN, Gradient Boosting Machines(GBM). The objective is to evaluate whether approach yields greater returns and superior risk-adjusted performance over a period. In addition, the research will investigate the use of technical indicators and ensemble learning methods to improve the accuracy of predictions and the performance of portfolios.
Technical indicators which are mathematically derived from past data on price, volume, or open interest. They are often used in technical analysis to forecast future price fluctuations. Technical indicators include moving averages, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Relative-strength-index(RSI).


Libraries Used:

yfinance: A library for fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

pandas: A data manipulation library in Python.

scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python.

matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
